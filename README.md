# Design Compass

Welcome to Design Compass, an open-source project born during Hacktoberfest 2024. Our mission is to create a comprehensive resource for UI/UX designers and developers to explore, analyze, and draw inspiration from mobile app design patterns.

## Project Vision

Design Compass aspires to be the go-to platform for navigating the ever-evolving landscape of mobile app design. Drawing inspiration from established resources like pttrns.com and mobbin.com, we're creating a user-friendly, searchable database of design patterns. Our platform will serve as a compass for designers and developers, guiding them through current trends, successful UI/UX implementations, and best practices in mobile app design.

## Project Structure

```
Design Compass/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflows/   # GitHub Actions workflows
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                 # Application code (Next.js)
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                # Unprocessed data folder
â”œâ”€â”€ json-generator/      # JSON data generator (Submodule)
â”œâ”€â”€ worker/              # Cloudflare Worker to upload data to R2
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitmodules          # Submodule configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

```

The `app` folder contains all the Next.js code for the Design Compass platform. The `data` folder is dedicated to storing unprocessed data, making it easier for non-technical contributors to add valuable content to the project. The `json-generator` submodule is a tool for generating JSON data easily, so that non-technical contributors can add data to the project. The `worker` folder contains the code for a Cloudflare Worker that uploads data to R2.
