# Design Compass

Welcome to Design Compass, an open-source project born during Hacktoberfest 2024. Our mission is to create a comprehensive resource for UI/UX designers and developers to explore, analyze, and draw inspiration from mobile app design patterns.

## Project Vision

Design Compass aspires to be the go-to platform for navigating the ever-evolving landscape of mobile app design. Drawing inspiration from established resources like pttrns.com and mobbin.com, we're creating a user-friendly, searchable database of design patterns. Our platform will serve as a compass for designers and developers, guiding them through current trends, successful UI/UX implementations, and best practices in mobile app design.

## Project Structure

```
Design Compass/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflows/   # GitHub Actions workflows
â”œâ”€â”€ _data/                # Unprocessed data folder

â”œâ”€â”€ json-generator/      # JSON data generator (Submodule)
â”œâ”€â”€ worker/              # Cloudflare Worker to upload data to R2

```

The `app` folder contains all the Next.js code for the Design Compass platform. The `_data` folder is dedicated to storing unprocessed data, making it easier for non-technical contributors to add valuable content to the project. The `json-generator` submodule is a tool for generating JSON data easily, so that non-technical contributors can add data to the project. The `worker` folder contains the code for a Cloudflare Worker that uploads data to R2.


## Getting Started for Non-Technical Contributors

1. Navigate to the [**JSON Generator**](http://json.dc.inovuslabs.org/) tool to upload images and data for mobile app screens.
2. Fill in the required fields and generate JSON data. Hit the "**Generate JSON**" button to preview the JSON data and **Copy to Clipboard**.
2. Navigate to the `_data` folder in this repository and create a subfolder for the app you're adding data for with the app's name. (e.g., `instagram`).
3. Create a new JSON file (file with `.json` extension) in the app's folder with the name of the screen you're adding data for. (e.g., `login.json`).
4. Paste the JSON data you generated into the new file and save it.
5. Submit a pull request with your changes to the repository.

### Special Note for Non-Technical Contributors

- To create a new folder and a file in the same commit, hit create new file and type `foldername/filename.json`. (e.g., `instagram/login.json`)
- You can contribute multiple screens for the same app by creating new JSON files in the same app folder.
---
- Please ensure that the JSON data you generate is accurate and complete.
- If you're unsure about any step, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers for help.
